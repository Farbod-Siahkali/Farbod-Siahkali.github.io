======
I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant in Prof. Vijay Gupta's Lab at Purdue University, where I investigate the application and analysis of conformal prediction in multi-view cooperative perception, trajectory optimization, and domain adaptation.

My research interests encompass:

- Conformal Prediction

- Control Theory

- Machine Learning

- Optimization
