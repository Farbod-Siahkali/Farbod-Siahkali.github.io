About Me
======
I am currently a Research Assistant in Prof. Vijay Gupta's Lab at Purdue University, where I investigate the application and analysis of conformal prediction in multi-view cooperative perception, trajectory optimization, and domain adaptation.

My research interests encompass:

- Conformal Prediction

- Control Theory

- Machine Learning

- Optimization

Publications
======
My scholarly contributions include:

- **Towards Opinion Shaping: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach in Bot-User Interactions** (September 2024, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11426)): This work explores the impact of interference in social networks using deep reinforcement learning.

- **Image-Based and Partially Categorical Annotating Approach for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition** (July 2023, available on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4373086)): Introduces the CA-Duke dataset and a two-step learning method with a novel Separation Index metric.

- **SIVD: Dataset of Iranian Vehicles for Real-Time Multi-Camera Video Tracking and Recognition** (December 2022, published in ICSPIS 2022, available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10043932)): Presents a new dataset with 29 classes and over 36,000 images for vehicle tracking and recognition.
