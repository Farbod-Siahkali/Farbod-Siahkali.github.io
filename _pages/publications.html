======
My scholarly contributions include:

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Epidemic Control of a Networked SIS Model** (September 2025, published in IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA) 2025, available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11151322)): Proposes a novel approach to reduce infection spread in a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).

- **Towards Opinion Shaping: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach in Bot-User Interactions** (September 2024, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11426)): This work explores the impact of interference in social networks using deep reinforcement learning.

- **Image-Based and Partially Categorical Annotating Approach for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition** (July 2023, available on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4373086)): Introduces the CA-Duke dataset and a two-step learning method with a novel Separation Index metric.

- **SIVD: Dataset of Iranian Vehicles for Real-Time Multi-Camera Video Tracking and Recognition** (December 2022, published in ICSPIS 2022, available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10043932)): Presents a new dataset with 29 classes and over 36,000 images for vehicle tracking and recognition.
